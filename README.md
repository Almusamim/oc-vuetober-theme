### Getting started

Before getting started, make sure you have [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) installed. Once that is taken care of, run the following command from your `/themes` directory.

```bash
$ vue init scottbedard/oc-vuetober-theme myawesometheme
$ cd myawesometheme
$ npm install
```

To build your site for production, run the following command.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

The development server can be fired up at `localhost:3000` by running the following.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

And finally, executing the test suite can be done with the following command.

```bash
npm test
```
