# oc-vuetober-theme

This project is an opinionated approach to single page applications within the wonderful worlds of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [October CMS](https://octobercms.com), and [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

### Getting started

In order to use this theme, you'll need to have a fair understanding of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). If you've never used this framework before, you can get the fundamentals down through [this free screencast series](http://vuecasts.com/).

To install a Vuetober theme, run the following commands from your `/themes` directory.

> **Note:** As of version 2.1, pulling in `vue-cli` is no longer neccessary.

```bash
# clone down the repository and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/scottbedard/oc-vuetober-theme.git mytheme
cd mytheme

# install dependencies
npm install

# build your entry point
npm run build

# set up the theme and dev environment
npm run setup
```

To run unit tests, execute the following command.

```bash
npm test
```
